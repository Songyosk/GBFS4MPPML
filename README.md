# GBFS4MPPML
Official implementation of "Gradient Boosted and Statistical Feature Selection Pipeline for Materials Property Predictions"

By S. G. Jung, G. J & J. M. Cole


## Introduction

The scripts herein are used to generate the results presented in the aforementioned paper. 

Jupyter Notebooks are provided along with the scripts. Their main purpose is to demonstrate the functionalities contained therein. 

For each property there are two Jupyter Notebooks: 

*(i) Featurize*

*(ii) GBFS*
